# A simple slider to practice JS/jQuery

## Pre-requisite(s) for Use 
- Images added must be of the same size if you want consistency. (You decide what looks good, but the demo uses 900x300.)


## Key for Task List
- [] to be done
- [+] did this but it wasn't on the todo list
- [x] done from todo list

## Todo

### Display
- [] display - decide breakpoint: when to break title container off and display it underneath the slider image (otherwise titles stay longer than image and look bad)
- [] display - control length of titles and excerpts (ellipsis '...' after max # of characters)
- [] display - add test to see when title divs are too small (i.e. when the title and date are getting cut off) and use that to 
- [] display - calculate size of titles based on # of slides to make sure titles/dates won't be obscured; if the div becomes too small, then use this in the decision breakpoint (see next item)
- [] prevent i-bar from coming up when hovering over controls (icing)
- [] how to fail gracefully when no slides are available? -> default slide? etc.

### Code refactoring & Testing
- [] test compatibility with different browsers + versions
- [] refactor - make code look neater (organize & comment)
- [] better way to manipulate currentSlide global ?
- [] make dots click callback into own function (maybe)
- [] make allSlides list a global since it's used in multiple places (may not matter)

- [x] (Apr 3 17) refactor - separate JS, CSS, and HTML into separate files
- [x] (Apr 3 17) nav functionality - dots can be clicked and brought to the right slide
- [+] (Apr 3 17) added dots generation as ul and also dot highlight in accordance with slide movement
- [x] (Mar 30 17) nav functionality - left/right arrows flip through slides
- [x] (Mar 28 17) slide functionality - split slide() up into prev() and forward()
- [x] (Mar 21 17) sliding functionality - highlight current title on right side corresponding to current slide
- [x] (Mar 20 17) populate titles based on slides
- [x] (Mar 20 17) sliding functionality - flipping through images and excerpts
- [x] (Mar 20 17) nav - display # of dots according to # of slides
- [x] (Mar 20 17) reorganize so that each slide, title, categories, excerpt, etc. are together in one li for ease of wordpress-ifying
- [+] (Mar 20 17) changed navigators to unicode symbols
- [x] (Mar 15 17) add classes and spans/divs to control styling (e.g. spans for titles, dates if will add them)
- [x] (Mar 13 17) Make responsive height/width-wise so can be plugged in to any layout (e.g. Bootstrap)
	- responsive width-wise most important for scaling

## Notes

### Issue [Resolved]: Not adding posts categorized as 'Featured' but which have no thumbnail

(Jun 13 17) Used ```if ( has_post_thumbnail() )``` to make sure no posts without an image makes it into the slider. However, this then impacts the number of slides that make it into the slider -- it will not take the top 5 posts without an image, it will take the top 5 posts & then only display those with images (e.g. if 2/5 have no image, then slider will only have 3 slides). This is probably because the query is running before the IF; need to find a way to find the top 5 with image as 1 query.

Solution: Used ```meta_key``` in ```WP_Query``` arguments list to grab posts with filled field ```_thumbnail_id```, meaning they have attached thumbnail images.

### Issue: UNICODE arrows displaying as different sizes

(Jun 6 17) For some reason, &#9668; displays as smaller than &#9658;, even when font-size property was set. Ditched the symbols for <> brackets for now (or permanently).

### Issue [Resolved]: jQuery broken when wordpressified

(Jun 5 17) Once got posts to populate, jQuery worked to cycle through but adding dots, alignment of divs, some other things broke. Currently will strip features and see about restoring basic sliding functionality, then build on top of that to return features.

Addendum 1: Fixed HTML structure which restored some JS functionality. Dots still being weird. Alignment still off. Possibly issue with insufficient post content-> strangely sized, sometimes missing, images, etc.

Addendum 2: Cycling is still weird, titles not linking to correct images, some counter is off somewhere.

Addendum 3: Seems like there is an issue with WP thumbnails in the wordpress install itself, or some configuration of plugins or the theme which is upsetting this.

Solution: Counter discrepancy was caused by selecting ALL li children of ul.slide-list by '.slide-list li'. Changed to immediate descendant selection, '.slide-list > li' and this rectified the issue.

### jQuery selectors

(Apr 3 17) In its current iteration, the nature of the CSS classes and the way they're selected by jQuery means that only one of these sliders should be used on a page at a single time. This is OK for my purposes, but in the future should make it multiple-iteration-proof just for robustness, especially if it will be WordPress-ified.

### slideBackward()

seems to make a weird skipping effect when changing slides,e.g. from the first to the last when going around, or sometimes in the middle. need to check if this repeats on other machines. may not be an issue, since this method will be used once at a time when arrows are clicked, and not for continuous motion like  slideForward()

### Controls (Unicode)

Left arrow (for previous) - &#9668; ```&#9668;```

Right arrow (for next) - &#9658; ```&#9658;```

Open square (navigation dot, unhighlighted) - &#9633; ```&#9633;```

Closed square (navigation dot, highlighted) - &#9632; ```&#9632;```
