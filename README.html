A simple slider to practice JS/jQuery
Pre-requisite(s): 
- images added must be of a certain size (you decide what looks good, but something like 900x300 is what this demo uses)

Todo:
[] sliding functionality - flipping through images and excerpts
[] sliding functionality - "selecting" current title on right side
[] nav functionality - left/right arrows
[] nav functionality - dots
[] control length of titles and excerpts (elipsis '...' after max # of characters) for display purposes
[] complete a mockup that looks like finished product, to make sure styles are set
[] Separate JS, CSS, and HTML into separate files
[] wordpress-ify (eventually will be a post slider plugin, so slides + titles auto-generated)

Done:
[x] (Mar 15 17) add classes and spans/divs to control styling (e.g. spans for titles, dates if will add them)
[x] (Mar 13 17) Make responsive height/width-wise so can be plugged in to any layout (e.g. Bootstrap)
	- responsive width-wise most important for scaling
